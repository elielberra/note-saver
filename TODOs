Mandatory
- Update README
- Deploy through Kubernetes. Create a Helm chart for the apps
- Add Prometheus metrics
- Use terraform to create a cluster with EKS

Nice to have but probably won't be done
- Add a wrapper to amqp libraries to rabbitmq client an consumer so that they automatically reconnect
